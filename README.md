## 1. Project Overview

The global coffee market is characterized by significant price volatility, influenced by factors such as climate change, geopolitical events, and shifting consumer demand. For a specialty coffee company like Ekata Earth, the ability to respond to these market dynamics is crucial for maintaining profitability and competitive advantage.

The **Ekata Earth Dynamic Pricing Engine** is a comprehensive decision-support tool designed to empower the company's management with actionable, data-driven intelligence. The platform aggregates and visualizes key market indicators, including:

-   **Historical & Forecasted Commodity Prices:** Tracks daily futures for Arabica and Robusta beans and provides a 30-day price forecast.
-   **Real-Time Climate Data:** Monitors weather conditions in key coffee-growing estates worldwide, a leading indicator of future supply.
-   **Competitor Pricing:** Gathers and displays current retail prices from key competitors in the Indian market.
-   **AI-Powered Strategic Insights:** Synthesizes all available data to generate strategic recommendations for sourcing, inventory, and pricing.

A key feature of the application is its ability to ingest custom, user-provided sales and pricing data via CSV upload, allowing for a fully customized analysis and forecast based on the company's own historical performance.

## 2. System Architecture & Technology Stack

The application is built on a modern, component-based web architecture, leveraging a serverless backend to ensure security and scalability.

-   **Frontend Framework:** **React 18** with **Vite** for a fast, modern development experience and optimized builds.
-   **Language:** **TypeScript** for type safety, improved code quality, and maintainability.
-   **Styling:** **Tailwind CSS** for a utility-first approach to building a responsive and visually consistent user interface.
-   **Data Visualization:** **Recharts** for creating interactive and responsive charts to display price trends.
-   **Backend:** **Vercel Serverless Functions** to host a secure, server-side proxy that communicates with the generative AI model. This architecture protects sensitive API credentials by preventing them from being exposed on the client-side.
-   **Deployment:** The entire application is deployed on the **Vercel** platform, which provides continuous integration and delivery, scalability, and global content delivery network (CDN) capabilities.

## 3. Core Features & Components

The user interface is organized into several distinct, synergistic components:

#### 3.1. Header & Controls
The main header provides the application's title, a "Refresh Data" button to fetch the latest market information, and an "Upload CSV" button. The CSV upload functionality allows users to input their own historical price data, which dynamically updates the entire dashboard.

#### 3.2. Price Trends & Forecast Chart
This is the central component of the dashboard. It visualizes:
-   **Historical Prices:** A 30-day history of Arabica and Robusta coffee futures.
-   **AI-Powered Forecast:** A 30-day forward-looking forecast generated by the backend AI model.
The chart clearly delineates historical data from the forecasted period, enabling users to understand past trends and future projections at a glance.

#### 3.3. AI-Powered Strategic Insights
This component leverages a generative AI model to analyze all the data presented on the dashboard—historical prices, forecasts, and competitor data—to produce actionable recommendations in three key areas:
-   **Sourcing Strategy:** Advises on procurement decisions between Arabica and Robusta based on price trends.
-   **Inventory Management:** Recommends adjustments to stock levels based on price forecasts.
-   **Pricing Strategy:** Provides context on market positioning relative to competitors and suggests potential price adjustments for consumer products.

#### 3.4. Real-Time Estate Climate Dashboard
This interactive module provides live weather data from major coffee-growing regions across the globe (e.g., Minas Gerais, Brazil; Coorg, India). Users can select an estate from a list to view current temperature, humidity, and wind speed. This data is fetched from the Open-Meteo public API and serves as a vital indicator of potential impacts on crop yields and future supply.

#### 3.5. Indian Competitor Watch
To provide a view of the domestic market, this component displays the latest retail prices for standard coffee products from key Indian competitors like Blue Tokai Coffee Roasters and Araku Coffee. This data is retrieved by the AI model in real-time upon page load or refresh.

## 4. Data Processing & Workflow

The application follows a logical data flow to ensure information is timely and relevant.

**A. Initial Application Load & Data Refresh:**
1.  **Parallel Fetch:** The frontend initiates two parallel API calls through the serverless backend: one to fetch 30-day historical coffee prices and another to retrieve current competitor prices.
2.  **Forecast Generation:** Once the historical price data is received, it is immediately sent back to the AI model to generate a 30-day forecast.
3.  **Data Combination:** The historical and forecasted data are combined and rendered in the Price Chart.
4.  **Insight Generation:** With all data now available (historical, forecast, competitor), a final call is made to the AI model to generate the strategic insights for Sourcing, Inventory, and Pricing.
5.  **UI Update:** All components are populated with the fetched and generated data.

**B. Custom Data Upload (CSV):**
1.  **User Action:** The user clicks "Upload CSV" and selects a local file. The file must contain columns for `date`, `arabica_price`, and `robusta_price`.
2.  **Client-Side Parsing:** The application parses the CSV file in the browser, validating its structure and data integrity.
3.  **State Update:** The parsed data replaces the initial historical price data in the application's state.
4.  **Dynamic Re-Analysis:** The new, user-provided historical data triggers a new forecast generation and a subsequent new insight generation, following steps 2-5 from the initial load workflow. The entire dashboard is updated to reflect the custom data.

## 5. AI & Forecasting Methodology

Instead of relying on a traditional, pre-built statistical model (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet), this project employs a novel approach by utilizing a large language model (LLM) for time-series forecasting.

The methodology involves providing the LLM with the structured historical price data and instructing it via a carefully crafted prompt to perform a sophisticated forecast. The prompt explicitly directs the model to **"use a methodology that mimics a sophisticated forecasting model like XGBoost, considering trends, and volatility."**

This technique leverages the advanced pattern-recognition capabilities of the LLM to analyze the data and generate a forecast that considers complex, non-linear relationships, similar to how advanced machine learning models operate. This approach offers high flexibility and avoids the need for extensive model training and maintenance, making it ideal for a rapid-development academic project while still delivering high-quality, context-aware results.

## 6. Setup and Local Development

To run this project locally, follow these steps:
